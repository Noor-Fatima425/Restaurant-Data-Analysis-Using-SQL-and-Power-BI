The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of Balaji Restaurant for the year 2022-23. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as sales per item, customer preferences, payment modes, and monthly sales trends. The project also involves importing flat file into SSMS, cleaning raw data, inserting it neatly into "Restaurant" table and handling missing values to preserve data integrity. Later, the table is exported to Power BI to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create an interactive dashboard to visualize insights effectively.
